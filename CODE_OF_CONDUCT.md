# Code of Conduct

We, the contributors of this project, pledge to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone who wishes to participate in our community, regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, socioeconomic status, religion, or any other characteristic that makes them who they are.

As contributors, we agree to:

- Be respectful and kind to others in all our interactions, whether in person or online.
- Use welcoming and inclusive language, and avoid using derogatory or offensive terms.
- Value and respect diverse viewpoints and experiences, and seek to understand different perspectives.
- Be open to feedback and constructive criticism, and respond graciously to both praise and criticism.
- Focus on the issues and ideas being discussed, rather than on the individuals involved.
- Help create a safe and supportive community by reporting any behavior that violates this code of conduct.

We believe that everyone has the right to feel safe and respected in our community, and we are committed to fostering a culture of kindness, inclusivity, and mutual respect.

If you encounter any behavior that violates this code of conduct, please contact the project maintainer(s) immediately. We will take any necessary action to address the situation and ensure that our community remains a welcoming and supportive place for all.

This code of conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1.
